## Database planning
![Screenshot database structure](static/assets/images/database.png)
After defining the project goals and the core features I wanted to include, I used Creately to outline the database structure visually. This initial database schema serves as a foundational guide, showcasing the types of data entities and how they relate to one another. The diagram provides a clear layout of the primary tables, including Users, Reservations, and Tables, along with the key relationships between them.

This structure not only assists in understanding data flow and connections but also offers a blueprint for implementing and expanding on the projectâ€™s database as development progresse
