# UX

## Goals and Target Audience
Dar Tangier is designed for food enthusiasts, locals, and tourists looking to experience authentic Moroccan cuisine in Munich. The website provides essential features for easy reservation and navigation, suitable for individuals, families, and groups looking to dine at Dar Tangier. 

## Design

The Dar Tangier website embraces a color palette inspired by traditional Moroccan decor, with warm and inviting tones that reflect the ambiance of the restaurant:

- Mahogany and Sand: Rich shades of mahogany and warm sand tones are used as primary colors, 
evoking the earthy warmth and sophistication associated with Moroccan architecture and interior design.
- Accents of Deep Orange and Gold: These accents are used sparingly to highlight call-to-action buttons, enhancing user navigation while fitting the Moroccan theme of hospitality and vibrancy.
- Ivory and Off-White Backgrounds: These tones provide a clean and welcoming background that contrasts beautifully with the deeper colors, ensuring readability and a visually pleasing experience.

This color scheme not only aligns with Moroccan aesthetics but also helps create an inviting, elegant atmosphere for users exploring the restaurant’s offerings and making reservations.

## Database planning
## Initial data structure

After defining the project goals and the core features I wanted to include, I used Creately to outline the database structure visually. This initial database schema serves as a foundational guide, showcasing the types of data entities and how they relate to one another. The diagram provides a clear layout of the primary tables, including Users, Reservations, and Tables, along with the key relationships between them.

This structure not only assists in understanding data flow and connections but also offers a blueprint for implementing and expanding on the project’s database as development progresse.

## Final data structure

After refining the project and finalizing essential featured, I adjusted the initial database schema to accommodate specific requirements for user management, reservation scheduling, and table availability. Using Creately, I visually outlined the final data structure, focussing on theUser, Table, and Reservation tables, and their relationships. 

## Wireframes
To plan the layout and functionality of each page, wireframes were created with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as visual guides for the user interface.
These wirframes helped outline essential elements and streamline the design process by providing a clear structure for key components like the homepage, menu, reservation system and User profile Management on different screen sizes.
